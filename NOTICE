ACVTool 2.0 MULTIDEX

ACVTool Version 2.0 MULTIDEX represents a significant upgrade from the previously published ACVTool 0.2 and ACVCut 1.0. Originally developed by Aleksandr Pilgun at the University of Luxembourg, these tools are the result of his original research and can be accessed via the Zenodo repository and GitHub releases. The release of ACVTool 2.0 introduces new functionality and improvements that impact all files under the github.com/pilgun/acvtool URL. ACVTool 2.0 adheres to the Apache 2.0 license.

The following changes apply to ACVTool 2.0, including but not limited to:
- Shrinking functionality and other improvements initially released under the ACVCut name (https://github.com/pilgun/acvcut)
- Updated Apkil Tree Structure
- Multidex support in terms of instrumenting, report generation and shrinking
- Multi-apk installation support
- Instrumentation implementation improvements
- Shrinking implementation improvements
- Report generation improvements
- Additional commands (snap, flush, calculate, shrink)
- Major code refactoring

The multidex smali instrumentation technique is protected by a patent. Users and contributors to ACVTool automatically receive a license for this patent within the scope of ACVTool, as governed by the Apache 2.0 license. However, other implementations, re-implementations, or translations into different programming languages may require separate patent licensing.

Contributions to ACVTool are subject to the Contributer License Agreement (to be defined).
